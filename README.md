# Selenium Testing

Generated by [Seleniumbase](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase), using [Selenium Web Driver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) and automated by [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)

## Installing

#### Install Python 2.7

This developer is too lazy to compile SeleniumBase with Python3 - will use 2.7 until someone else updates

#### Install [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) 

In the root directory of this project, run:

```
source scripts/install.sh
```

#### Add Poetry to your PATH in shell config (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc)

```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.poetry/bin
```

You may need to source the file for changes to take effect.


#### Install dependencies with Poetry

In the root directory of this project, run:

```
poetry install
```

## Running the tests

```
source scripts/run-test.sh
```
